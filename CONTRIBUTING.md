# Contributing to NL Portal

## Adding a feature or bugfix to NL Portal

1. Create an issue in the [NL Portal issues repository](https://github.com/nl-portal/nl-portal-issues) to discuss your contribution. This is to reduce the work that is required, as it can both reduce the chances of feedback and allows for the NL Portal team to provide some pointers on how to proceed.
2. Implement the feature/bugfix and create a PR to the development branch. No reviewers are necessary.
3. Write release notes and documentation for the feature. See below for instructions on how to do this.
4. Merge the branch after getting an approval from the NL Portal team.
