# Release notes

This section contains the release notes for the different versions of NL-Portal. These release notes contain information
on what is new, bugs that have been fixed, breaking changes, code that has been deprecated, and known issues for that
release version. Additionally, when a new version does not work out of the box, migration notes are present.

This section is intended for everyone who wants to know what changed in a version of NL-Portal. Migration notes are
intended for more technical users, e.g. a system administrator who wants to keep their NL-Portal installation up to date.
