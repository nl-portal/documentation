# NL Portal

NL Portal is an application for communicating with citizens and third parties. It is built for use with the Dutch 'VNG APIâ€™s voor Zaakgericht Werken' - though not required. The development is based on Common Ground principles. Under the motto 'create once, use 340 times', the NL Portal has been built open source, so any (government) organization can use and improve it without restrictions.

Starting principles are:

- Open standards, open source under EUPL 1.2;
- Compatible with multiple formbuilders;
- Frontend UI based in NL Design System;
- Independent of underlying process- or case management systems;
- Horizontal scalable;
- A-sync communication with underlying systems.
